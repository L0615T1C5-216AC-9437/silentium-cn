### Description
silentium, `/block` people who are annoying or douche's.
### Downloading a Jar
1) go to [releases](https://github.com/L0615T1C5-216AC-9437/silentium-cn/releases) and download latest version, (not recommended to use alpha)
2) follow [#Installing](https://github.com/L0615T1C5-216AC-9437/silentium-cn/blob/master/README.md#installing)

### Building a Jar

1) download src.
2) run gradlew.bat
3) go to the plugin folder in cmd. (example: `cd C:\user\one\desk\pluginfolder\`)
4) type (Windows:`gradlew jar`, Linux:`./gradlew jar`) and execute.
5) done, look for plugin.jar in pluginfolder\build\libs\

Note: Highly recommended to use [Java 8](https://java.com/en/download/).

### Installing

Simply place the output jar from the step above in your server's `config/mods` directory and restart the server.  
List your currently installed plugins/mods by running the `mods` command.

### Configuration and Info

Files are stored in your system. (Windows: `C:\users\user\mind_db\silentium.cn` / Linux: `/home/user/mind_db/silentium.cn`)  
This is so the async list and settings are applied to all servers, *if* hosted on the same machine/instance/account.  

To edit settings, use the server-commands provided.
